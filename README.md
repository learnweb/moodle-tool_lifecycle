# Course Life Cycle (moodle-tool_lifecycle)

This module is currently in development.
The goal is to create a modular plugin, which allows the to execute recurring tasks within moodle associated with courses. 
Possible use cases are (not limited to):
   - Deleting courses at end of life (including asking teachers for permission).
   - Doing a rollover at the end of a semester.
   - Automatically setting an end date for courses.
   
To be adaptable to the needs of different institutions the plugin will provide multiple subplugin types.
Those can be adjusted to the needs of your institution.
For more information please have a look at the [wiki](https://github.com/learnweb/moodle-tool_lifecycle/wiki).
