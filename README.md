This plugin provides a modular framework, similar to a workflow engine, which allows the to execute recurring tasks within moodle associated with courses. 
Possible use cases are (not limited to):
   - Deleting courses at end of life (including asking teachers for permission).
   - Doing a rollover at the end of a semester.
   - Automatically setting an end date for courses.
   
To be adaptable to the needs of different institutions the plugin provides two subplugin types:

**Trigger**: These subplugins control the conditions a course have to meet so that a specific process is started for it.

**Step**: These subplugins represent atomic, reusable tasks that should be executed for a specific course.

Requirements that are specific to your institution can be added through additional subplugins.
For more information please have a look at the [wiki](https://github.com/learnweb/moodle-tool_lifecycle/wiki).
It provides instructions for administrators as well as for developers to implement own requirements into subplugins.

============

Moodle version
==============
The plugin is continously tested with all moodle versions, which are security supported by the moodle headquarter.
