# moodle-lifecycle-movecategorystep

[WIP] This is a step-subplugin for the admin tool [moodle-tool_lifecycle](https://github.com/learnweb/moodle-tool_lifecycle). 
It simply moves the triggered courses to a category which can be specified in the step configuration.
For example, here at the University of Würzburg we use this plugin to move older courses to an invisible category (before we finally delete them).

## Settings
Site administrators selects one category (from a dropdown) where the courses will be moved to.  

## More information  
For detailed information on step plugins visit the 
[Wiki](https://github.com/learnweb/moodle-tool_lifecycle/wiki) of the moodle-tool_lifecycle admin tool.
